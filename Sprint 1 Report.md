# Sprint 1 Report (8/26/21 - 9/8/2021)

## What's New (User Facing)

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
In this sprint, our team have completed our Project Description document, which includes sections such as Introduction, Background and Related Work, Project Overview, Client and Stakeholder Identification and Preferences, Glossary, and References. We have also set up our project repository with a README file and a Sprint Report. We did not work on any codes for this sprint. Instead, we focused on working with our client to figure out their requirements and summarizing these requirements into our project description. We also created beginning coding tasks/issues to work on in our next sprint.
